            <p className="aboutMe">I'm a full stack developer working at Piktorlabs Inc. Prior to this, I worked as a software engineer at Moonraft innovation Labs, Bengaluru for 2 years. I am a graduate of UVCE, Bengaluru, where I majored in BE. I currently live in Bengaluru. When Iâ€™m not keeping busy with coding, I enjoy travelling and cooking. Moving around a lot inspired me to travel and explore the world around me. I love learning about the historical and cultural significance of the places i visit. I also maintain a travel website called Trippospace which provides one space solution for all the travel needs. My other hobbies are cooking and soccer. I love to cook and I'm getting pretty good at it. I also love to play soccer and cricket. I used to play soccer regularly before COVID hit the world. I love to watch soccer and cricket as well. My favorite teams are FC Barcelona and Royal Challegers Bengaluru.</p>
